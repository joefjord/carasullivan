<h3>teaching philosophy</h3>
<img alt="class photograph of design one students" class="teachPhilo" src="assets/images/drawingClass.jpg" />
<p class="description philosophyP1">Teaching Foundations is more than teaching a student how to draw a representational image convincingly&mdash;though many first year students presume this is what drawing is all about. Some arrive over-confident, because they already possess this skill, while others arrive riddled with fear because they can&rsquo;t draw something &quot;realistic&quot; yet.<span id="dots">...</span></p>

<div id="more">My job is to meet students where they are, ratcheting up the perceptual acuity of those who are perplexed by drawing what is in front of them, and to challenge the sometimes conventional assumptions of the &quot;skilled set.&quot; Teaching the whole student is essential to a rewarding and productive Foundations experience. I make a point to find some strength a student possesses, even if it&#39;s what I call an &quot;almost&quot; strength&ndash;a motivating, kind word can be the difference between keeping a student in the program or losing them, particularly with the challenges many of our students face. I love being in the trenches with beginning students. If foundations is done right, students feel they have a place as they move forward. Having a sense of place provides the right conditions for creative growth and student success. Teaching in the core is a calling.
<p></p>

<p>Though I have a strong belief in mastering the use of&nbsp;materials and observation I am also deeply concerned with my students&rsquo; conceptual development and their ability to solve problems in creative and unexpected ways. I make a point to expose them to challenging artworks that are resolved in innovative ways&mdash;demonstrating that the interpretation of a given problem is an art form in itself.</p>

<p>My style in the classroom is energetic and positive. I pose questions that may be realized and answered as students engage in the processes of design and drawing. Learning by doing, while also pointing to the larger implications of a given task. Through projects, and design and drawing exercises, I provide opportunities for students to question their assumptions, and to gain perceptual clarity. Even the seemingly mundane task of drawing a cardboard box from observation is turned on its head as we discuss the fact that boxes are everywhere; the drawings will be placed in a box (the flat files), we are drawing from inside a box (the room), which is inside another box (the building), and as the class closes, I show them an image of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in NYC and ask them to take in the impressive scale and beauty of what is essentially, a giant stack of boxes. Drawing has its hand in everything.</p>

<p>My classrooms are not only a place where my students&rsquo; artistic dexterity is tested, but also a place where the act of playing is a serious endeavor. Though creating art is a rigorous and often intimidating endeavor, fostering curiosity and play as a serious matter sets an example for a lifelong practice. Group activities that are playful build camaraderie, and set the stage for students to tackle an assignment with openness to possibility. Though the task may seem absurd (doing a Jane Fonda workout video while standing on a large, toned ground paper)&mdash;&mdash;everyone participates. A slightly jarring experience (realizing you won&rsquo;t be wearing your shoes in class today) is one everyone will be talking about later. Their bodies become the drawing tool, creating an abstraction of a quintessential video trope, but also a residual fact of their experience in the studio that day&mdash;in essence a representation. Philosophical propositions abound.</p>

<p>No matter what the daily objective is in the studio, whether it is intense observational drawing, solving a design problem, creative play and experimentation, or critique, my classroom is a cell phone free zone. Unable to scroll, students must engage in a different way of looking. At the close of each class, I project one image on the wall, which I refer to as our &quot;moment of Zen&quot; (a la the Daily Show) and ask the class to sit in silence for one minute. This is an opportunity for students to look, and then look deeper, before being released back into the chaos of daily life. They are learning to see.</p>

<p>It is my goal as a Foundations instructor to help my students develop the ability to articulate their thoughts and desires through visual means. Ultimately, I want to provide students with the knowledge, perspective and drive to move through the art program prepared for their upper level courses, on their way to becoming successful artists and designers, and participating in and adding depth to our culture.</p>
